OMPSIM
====
A Discrete Event Simmulation Experiment. In this strategy events drive the clock. There is a series of seed events that when run create other events and so on. The clock jumps to the time of the next event.

The starting code is loosely based on http://www.cs.vu.nl/~eliens/sim/sim_html which I found easy to understand. This is posssibly very outdated.
